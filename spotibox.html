    <h2>A little backstory</h2>
    <p>This was my final project for my Intro to iOS/Swift Programming course. All acknowledgements, resources and the source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/vinceajcs/SpotiBox">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>About the process</h2>
    <div class="process-description">
      <p>Throughout the semester, we learned to leverage different APIs that could be then be used in our apps. Such examples include the Pokemon API to make a Pokedex, and the Google Maps API to locate and track favorite resturaunts. We were given free
        rein as to what we wanted to create for our final project; since I pretty much use Spotify everyday, I decided to check out Spotify's Web API.
      </p>


      <p>One of the biggest challenges of this project was integrating the iOS Spotify SDK. This was needed in order to gain greater access to Spotify's Web API, as I needed a way to implement login authentication and audio streaming. I spent a good amount
        of time searching for tutorials online - this was because while Spotify does have documentation on how to use their SDK and API, it primarily deals with older versions of Swift and Objective-C.
      </p>

      <p>Another aspect that took a while was trying to synchronize the slider and its value with the time of the song. As the song played, I had to make sure the slider's value was updating porportional to the duration of the entire song. Similarly, if
        the slider was moved backwards or forwards, I had to make sure that the song would follow suit and start playing from the right time. I ended up accomplishing this, thanks in part to the use of a timer, though there is probably a better way to
        do this.
      </p>

      <p>More features definitely could be added to this app. Most notably, the option to add favorite songs to a playlist. When I started this project, I thought about making an app that could allow people to add songs to a collaborative playlist when they
        entered a party, started a road trip, or something similar. This way, everyone could get to listen to music that resonated with them. Then I realized, wait...you can pretty much already do this with Spotify.

        <p>Nonetheless, I had a lot of fun making this app. I learned a little about creating music players.

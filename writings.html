      <h2>2.9.16, a spoken-word poem</h2>
      <p id="poem">I could spend all day talking about what I like
        <br/>Girls, chocolate, balling to be like Mike
        <br/>But let's be real - here's what really matters
        <br/>I don't want this to be all empty chatters
        <br/>I have been blessed with family and friends
        <br/>Their souls illuminate and their love transcends
        <br/>

        <br/>Still there are days when I'm lost
        <br/>Stuck in a world full of frost
        <br/>I see the sun, I really do
        <br/>It seems too good to be true
        <br/>They say Icarus flew too close
        <br/>To what he wanted the most
        <br/>Is it really such a crime
        <br/>To fight for what I feel is mine?
        <br/>All I want is to leave my mark
        <br/>Shake the seas like a whale shark
        <br/>

        <br/>But I’m scared man, I'm scared
        <br/>Of being an animal ensnared
        <br/>Sometimes I feel like I don't belong
        <br/>And I know I may not be Neil Armstrong
        <br/>But I sure as hell could walk on the moon
        <br/>Before you could say it's just a cartoon
        <br/>That it's just another silly dream
        <br/>No, you see, greatness is in my bloodstream
        <br/>Yes, I may not always be understood
        <br/>But I believe I'll end up in my version of Hollywood
        <br/>Nothing great ever happened to those
        <br/>Who tried to be like one of them everyday Joes'
        <br/>

        <br/>There's a myth that tells a story
        <br/>We once had four legs and four arms, looking for glory
        <br/>Yet we were too powerful and so Zeus decided
        <br/>It was time for us to be divided
        <br/>He cursed us to forever roam the Earth
        <br/>Until we found the half that gave us mirth
        <br/>It's beautiful, don't you think?
        <br/>To spend your whole life looking for that lost link
        <br/>Yet it's scary to think about searching for her
        <br/>When my whole future is such a blur
        <br/>Truth be told I don't even know who I am
        <br/>For all I know I could be one huge traffic jam
        <br/>

        <br/>I'm scared man, I'm scared
        <br/>Of being the one who dared
        <br/>To do something extraordinary
        <br/>Only to fail to complete the Hail Mary
        <br/>In football if you lose you try again next year
        <br/>But you only get one chance to live in this atmosphere
        <br/>When night falls I gaze at the stars
        <br/>And wonder if the whole world could be ours
        <br/>Then I look at the people I'm surrounded by
        <br/>And realize it's all sunshine and blue sky
        <br/>

        <p>She glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me. I imagined she was going to say,
          <i>You killed a minotaur!</i> or <i>Wow, you're so awesome!</i> or something like that.
          <br/>Instead, she said, 'You drool when you sleep.'
          <br/> - Rick Riordan, <i>The Lightning Thief</i></p>

        <p>The most significant thing about The Catholic Worker is poverty, some say. The most significant thing is community, others say. We are not alone anymore. But the final word is love. At times it has been, in the words of Father Zossima, a harsh
          and dreadful thing, and our very faith in love has been tried through fire. We cannot love God unless we love each other, and to love we must know each other. We know him in the breaking of bread, and we are not alone any more. Heaven is a banquet
          and life is a banquet, too, even with a crust, where there is companionship. We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community. It all happened while we sat there talking,
          and it is still going on.
          <br/> - Dorothy Day, <i>The Long Loneliness</i></p>

        <p>We're so young. We're so young. We're twenty-two years old. We have so much time. There’s this sentiment I sometimes sense, creeping in our collective conscious as we lay alone after a party, or pack up our books when we give in and go out – that
          it is somehow too late. That others are somehow ahead. More accomplished, more specialized. More on the path to somehow saving the world, somehow creating or inventing or improving. That it’s too late now to BEGIN a beginning and we must settle
          for continuance, for commencement.
          <br/> - Marina Keegan, <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/"><i>The Opposite of Loneliness</i></a></p>


        <p>...we have to keep reminding ourselves, over and over: 'This is water, this is water.'
          <br/> - David Foster Wallace, <a href="http://www.metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf"><i>This is Water</i></a></p>

        <p>'You'll stay with me?
          <br/>Until the very end,' said James.
          <br/> - J.K. Rowling, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i></p>

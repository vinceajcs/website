        <h1>Where do I start?</h1>
        <p>I'm a dreamer at heart. Chocolate will be the death of me. I think Eminem is a <em>genius</em>.
          Speaking of artists and music, check out my Spotify playlists <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/11137108125?si=JHiM5I7xQISpTtx6g5UbrA">here</a>.

        <p>I most recently graduated from Boston College an year early, and I wouldn't trade that liberal arts education for anything else.
          I never thought that the theology and philosophy courses I took would be among my favorites, but that's how it turned out.
          In fact, I was one course away from completing my philosophy minor. <em>Object Oriented Design</em> with Professor Edward Sciore was, without a doubt, the best experience on my way to a CS degree.
          Now, I'm ready for my next adventure. I'm not sure what the future holds, but creative technology is something that's really appealing to me right now.
          I'm currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area, in Mountain View.
